Say hello to Ruby Sage. A twitter bot written in ruby.

The bot can currently only respond to trivially simply questions but plans are
afoot for more sophisticate behaviour.

This project was started by Stephen, Hamish and Anthony in an attempt to learn 
more about Ruby, Twitter and Git. And to have some geeky fun.

== Gem Dependencies

* twitter
* chronic
* hashie
* yaml
* rdoc
* yahoo-weather

== Usage

For usage details see the help within sage.rb or run "sage.rb -h"

Run "rdoc sage.rb" to create HTML documentation within a doc folder.

At the very least you will need to enter your twitter login details into
config/account.yml.

== Local testing

If you are just having a play or developing a plugin then run in local test
mode by doing "sage.rb -t". You might also want to run in verbose mode so
you can see what is going on with "sage.rb -t -V".

When you are in test mode YAML files are used in place of the Twitter API.

Enjoy!
